# UK Employment Dashboard ‚Äì Tableau Project

## üéØ What I Built
As part of my justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze changes in the UK job market between 2011 and 2014. Using a dataset from EMSI, the dashboard visualizes job growth and decline across various cities and industries, allowing users to explore regional employment trends.

## üí° Key Things I Learnt
- **Tableau Fundamentals**: I learned to connect to an Excel data source and build a dashboard from scratch.
- **Geographic Mapping**: I created a map visualization to show job change data distributed across UK cities.
- **Calculated Fields**: I created new fields in Tableau to calculate the percentage change in jobs, providing deeper insights than the raw numbers alone.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: I combined multiple worksheets (a map, bar charts, etc.) into a single dashboard and added filters, making the data exploration experience interactive for the user.
- **Publishing to Web**: I learned how to publish my completed workbook to Tableau Public to share a live, interactive version of my work.

## üîç Top Insights
| Insight | Evidence | Business Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| London was the engine of job growth | The dashboard shows London had the largest absolute increase in jobs (+168,830) between 2011 and 2014. | London's economy was expanding rapidly, making it a key area for recruitment, investment, and business development during this period. |
| The Professional & Scientific sector boomed | The "PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES" industry saw the most significant job growth across the UK, especially in London. | This indicates a strong shift towards a knowledge-based economy. For job seekers, this was the top sector for opportunities. For businesses, it highlights a growing talent pool in these fields. |
| Some sectors saw significant decline | The "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEFENCE" sector experienced the largest job losses nationally. | This likely reflects government spending cuts during that period, impacting public sector employment across the country. |

#### Use of filter in dashboard

2.  Use the filters to select different cities or industries.
3.  Hover over different parts of the map or charts to see detailed tooltips with specific data points.

## üìÅ Project Files
- `EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx` - The raw dataset used for the analysis.
- `UK Employment Dashboard.twbx` - The packaged Tableau workbook file containing the dashboard and data.

## üéì Part of My Bootcamp Journey

## ü§î If I Had More Time
- I would join this data with a more recent dataset to analyze long-term trends beyond 2014.
- I would create a more detailed "drill-down" feature, allowing users to click on a city to see a new dashboard with a detailed industry breakdown for just that location.
